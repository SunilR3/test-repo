Course Project
All project-related materials is in the UCI HAR Dataset directory.
•	First unzip the source (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) into a folder on your local drive, in my case it is D:\R work directory\Programming Assignment-Datacleaning •             2nd I put run_analysis.R ie code for this assignment into D:\R work directory\Programming Assignment-Datacleaning
•	In RStudio then I set the work directory as  setwd("D:\R work directory\Programming Assignment-Datacleaning\UCI HAR Dataset\")
•      Run the code in R-studio by giving source("run_analysis.R")
•     For reading data use data <- read.table("data_set_with_the_averages.txt") to read the data.
